Do I require a silver label?,"Used manufactured homes (whether de-registered with the BC Manufactured Home Registry or not) may only be offered for sale in BC when they bear an approval label.
A new approval label is required where wiring of a used manufactured home has been completely removed and new wiring has been installed under a permit.
Alterations, including additional wiring to an approved unit must be done under a permit and a new approval label is not required.
When a manufactured home has had additions or outbuildings installed and wired without an electrical installation permit, an electrical contractor must obtain an installation permit, survey the work and submit a declaration confirming that the electrical installation is adequate for the purpose and in good order, in accordance with rule 2-300.
Alternate documentation, such as a letter from the manufacturer indicating that the unit was originally approved, cannot be accepted in place of an approval label. However, if original documentation exists (for example, a specification sheet with CSA number) and there have been no unpermitted alterations to the unit, a silver label may be applied by a safety officer upon notification of an inspection request under a silver label permit and confirmation that the installation is in good order in accordance with rule 2-300. A Used Mobile Home Inspection Report is not required under these circumstances.

Information Bulletin: Approval of Manufactured Homes and Factory-Built Structures
March 31, 2015
Reference Number: IB-EL 2015-02
Revision Number: Rev 3
This bulletin provides guidance on the application of Electrical Safety Regulation, section 21.

Overview
An approval (silver) label will only be applied where no other approval process is available.
An approval (silver) label will only be applied under a permit.
Electrical Safety Regulation (ESR) 21 requires all new factory-built structures or manufactured homes to display an approval mark from an accredited certification agency prior to sale.
When a label is not present, ESR 21(d) allows for used manufactured homes and used factory-built structures to display an approval label provided by the appropriate provincial safety manager. This is often referred to as a silver label.

The authority having jurisdiction may set requirements for equipment that it deems “approved” as noted in the BC Electrical Code. If alterations have been made, these structures result in a blend of CSA Part I and Part II standards and are deemed acceptable with supporting evidence.

Scope
This bulletin only applies to factory-built structures and manufactured homes that are designed to be connected to an external electrical supply.
It does not apply to recreational vehicles.
For recreational vehicles, refer to the Electrical Directive: Recreational Vehicles (D-EL 2015-01).

Definitions
Approved (as applied to electrical equipment):

Equipment certified by a Standards Council of Canada-accredited organization.
Equipment that conforms to the requirements of the regulatory authority.
Approval Label: A certification mark or silver label applied by an accredited certification body.

Commercially Produced: A structure produced with an emphasis on salability or profit.

Factory-Built Relocatable and Non-Relocatable Structures: See BC Electrical Code, rule 70-000.

Manufactured Home: A transportable, single- or multiple-section dwelling ready for occupancy.

Relocatable Structure: A towable structure for use without permanent foundations.

Silver Label: An approval label provided by Technical Safety BC under section 21(1)(d) of the Electrical Safety Regulation.

New Manufactured Homes
Must conform to certification standards and display an approval mark.
If missing an approval mark, the owner/vendor must apply to the certification agency.
Used Manufactured Homes
Can only be sold in BC if they bear an approval label.
If completely rewired, a new approval label is required.
Alterations must be done under a permit.
Unpermitted electrical work must be surveyed by an electrical contractor.
Original manufacturer documentation may be used if no alterations were made.
If no evidence of approval exists, a licensed electrical contractor must:
Obtain a silver label permit.
Survey and ensure compliance using the Used Mobile Home Inspection Report Form.
Submit the FRM-0206 Electrical Contractor Authorization and Declaration Form.
New & Used Factory-Built Structures
New structures must display an approval label.
If no label exists, the owner/vendor must request a special inspection.
Used factory-built structures can only be sold in BC if:
They have an approval mark.
The wiring has not been altered.
If no evidence of approval exists, a licensed electrical contractor must:
Obtain a silver label permit.
Ensure compliance and submit FRM-0206.
Exceptions
A silver label permit may be issued if:

No approval is possible through a certification agency.
The safety officer confirms the unit is not commercially produced.
