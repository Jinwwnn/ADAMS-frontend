Do I require a silver label?,"Used manufactured homes (whether de-registered with the BC Manufactured Home Registry or not) may only be offered for sale in BC when they bear an approval label.
A new approval label is required where wiring of a used manufactured home has been completely removed and new wiring has been installed under a permit.
Alterations, including additional wiring to an approved unit must be done under a permit and a new approval label is not required.
When a manufactured home has had additions or outbuildings installed and wired without an electrical installation permit, an electrical contractor must obtain an installation permit, survey the work and submit a declaration confirming that the electrical installation is adequate for the purpose and in good order, in accordance with rule 2-300.
Alternate documentation, such as a letter from the manufacturer indicating that the unit was originally approved, cannot be accepted in place of an approval label. However, if original documentation exists (for example, a specification sheet with CSA number) and there have been no unpermitted alterations to the unit, a silver label may be applied by a safety officer upon notification of an inspection request under a silver label permit and confirmation that the installation is in good order in accordance with rule 2-300. A Used Mobile Home Inspection Report is not required under these circumstances.

Information Bulletin: Approval of Manufactured Homes and Factory-Built Structures
March 31, 2015
Reference Number: IB-EL 2015-02
Revision Number: Rev 3
This bulletin provides guidance on the application of Electrical Safety Regulation, section 21.

Overview
An approval (silver) label will only be applied where no other approval process is available.
An approval (silver) label will only be applied under a permit.
Electrical Safety Regulation (ESR) 21 requires all new factory-built structures or manufactured homes to display an approval mark from an accredited certification agency prior to sale.
When a label is not present, ESR 21(d) allows for used manufactured homes and used factory-built structures to display an approval label provided by the appropriate provincial safety manager. This is often referred to as a silver label.

The authority having jurisdiction may set requirements for equipment that it deems “approved” as noted in the BC Electrical Code. If alterations have been made, these structures result in a blend of CSA Part I and Part II standards and are deemed acceptable with supporting evidence.

Scope
This bulletin only applies to factory-built structures and manufactured homes that are designed to be connected to an external electrical supply.
It does not apply to recreational vehicles.
For recreational vehicles, refer to the Electrical Directive: Recreational Vehicles (D-EL 2015-01).

Definitions

Must conform to certification standards and display an approval mark.
If missing an approval mark, the owner/vendor must apply to the certification agency.
Used Manufactured Homes
Can only be sold in BC if they bear an approval label.
If completely rewired, a new approval label is required.
Alterations must be done under a permit.

Be employed in the plant or an equivalent plant for a period of at least 12 months
If you want to apply for a Category A interim certificate because your power engineer needs more time to complete the required Class certificate, they must also have completed at least one exam towards their Fourth or Third Class certificate, or at least two exams towards their Second or First Class Power Engineer certificate.  You can apply for an interim certificate by following these steps:

Submit a completed application form via email.

Overview
An interim certificate of qualification entitles an engineer to exercise the full scope of a given power engineer certificate, for a limited period of time.

The purpose of an interim certificate is to assist companies through a period of time where they are unable to retain the services of a required class of Power Engineer.

Categories of interim certificates
There are two categories of interim certificates for Power Engineers.

Category A: this interim certificate is issued if the boiler capacity of a plant has increased, or a power engineer needs more time to complete the required examinations for their certificate. Category A interim certificates can remain active for up to 12 months and can be renewed once if the power engineer has attempted to pass their certification exam.

Category B: this interim certificate is issued if there are special circumstances in the plant such as illness, extended vacations, or emergencies. It can remain active for up to 60 days and can be renewed once for 30 more days.

Eligibility
A chief engineer of a plant may apply for an interim certificate on behalf of a power engineer. If there is no chief engineer, then the owner of the plant may apply instead.

In addition, the power engineer must:

Hold a power engineer certificate that is one class lower than required for the relevant position
Be employed in the plant or an equivalent plant for a period of at least 12 months
If you want to apply for a Category A interim certificate because your power engineer needs more time to complete the required Class certificate, they must also have completed at least one exam towards their Fourth or Third Class certificate, or at least two exams towards their Second or First Class Power Engineer certificate.

How to apply
You can apply for an interim certificate by following these steps:

Information Bulletin: Contractor Installation Permit Value Amendment Criteria
July 29, 2024
Reference Number:
IB-AT-2019-01

Revision Number:
Revision 1

This information bulletin is being issued to clarify your legal obligation to obtain an appropriate permit for all regulated work being performed, the criteria and process for amending the value of an active permit, and the potential consequences for performing regulated work under a permit that does not reflect the correct value or scope of work.

Legal Obligation to Obtain Permits
Section 12 of the Safety Standards General Regulation (SSGR) requires you to obtain an “appropriate permit” before performing regulated work, unless otherwise specified. For electrical and gas installation permits, an “appropriate permit” is a permit that accurately reflects the scope and value of work performed.

To assist you in obtaining an appropriate permit, TSBC has developed technology-specific fee schedules that describe the:

Types of permits available;
Scope and/or value of work that can be performed under each permit type; and
Associated permit fees payable to Technical Safety BC.
Fee Schedules, specific to your technology, may be accessed on our website at: https://www.technicalsafetybc.ca/learn-about/technical-safety-bc/fee-schedules

When to Amend the Value of a Permit
Permits that do not accurately reflect the scope and/or value of work must be amended in a timely manner. This includes instances of undervalued work where:

The scope and/or value of work changed over the course of the project and no longer reflects the scope or value of work noted on the permit at the time of purchase.
A duty holder purchases permit(s) that are not within the scope of the work being performed, or under an incorrect class of permits, resulting in a reduced permit value.
A duty holder purchases permit(s) and under-declares the cost of the project (e.g., underestimates costs associated with labour or materials), resulting in a reduced permit value.
NOTE: A permit reflecting the final value and scope of work must be in place before performing the work.

How to Amend a Permit
For gas permit amendments, contact Technical Safety BC at 1 866 566 7233. For electrical permit amendments, complete the Permit Value Amendment Form.
Provide the following information:
The original permit number;
The amended value of the work; and
Details on the change in the scope of work.
Pay the fee(s) as per the applicable technology fee schedule.
Possible Consequences of Undervalued Work
Technical Safety BC undertakes investigative activities, including compliance audits, when regulated work is performed under a permit that does not reflect the correct value or scope of work. Licensed contractors who have not obtained an appropriate permit and/or did not amend the value of a permit as required may be subject to enforcement action. This action may include, but is not limited to:

The issuance of a discipline order or compliance order,
The imposition of a monetary penalty, and/or
The suspension or revocation of their contractor licence.
Note: Investigative activities undertaken by Technical Safety BC in response to work being performed without an appropriate permit, including undervalued work/permits, may be subject to additional compliance and enforcement fees. For more information, please visit our website.

About Us
Print (PDF)

Our Jurisdiction
Technical Safety BC administers the Safety Standards Act and Railway Safety Act throughout British Columbia.

If you are installing, operating, manufacturing, altering, maintaining, or selling equipment in any of the technologies we regulate, you may be within Technical Safety BC jurisdiction. You can find out if your work is within our jurisdiction by reviewing the information below.

Technologies We Regulate
Technical Safety BC delivers safety services across the following technologies:

Electrical equipment and systems.
Natural gas and propane appliances and systems, including hydrogen.
Boilers, pressure vessels, and refrigeration systems.
Elevating devices, such as elevators and escalators.
Passenger ropeways, such as aerial trams and ski lifts.
Amusement devices.
Railways, including commuter rail.
Alternative Safety Approaches, which encompass complex and integrated technical systems involving several technologies.
Local Governments
Although Technical Safety BC oversees the safe installation and operation of technical systems across the province, some exemptions do exist in certain municipalities.

There are 10 municipalities that are delegated portions of the Safety Standards Act to issue electrical and/or gas permits and to perform assessments. Technical Safety BC typically does not issue permits or perform assessments for electrical or gas work and equipment in these areas. Because of this, it’s important to make sure you’re within Technical Safety BC jurisdiction before applying for a permit or requesting an assessment from us.

Any premise other than a fully detached dwelling if the gas meter pressure is 2 psi (14 kPa) or less and the total connected load is 409,600 BTU/hr (120 kW) or less.
Technical Safety BC has jurisdiction over all other regulated gases such as propane, methane, and hydrogen.

Although these 10 jurisdictions have oversight for electrical and/or gas, Technical Safety BC still oversees contractor licensing and certification of qualified individuals and provides oversight for all other technologies we regulate.

We also work closely with local governments to share safety information and standardize application of the Safety Standards Act.

Local governments that issue their own permits and perform their own electrical and/or gas assessments:

City of Burnaby (Electrical and Gas)
City of Kelowna (Gas only)
City of Maple Ridge (Electrical and Gas)
City of North Vancouver (Electrical and Gas)
District of North Vancouver (Electrical and Gas)
City of Richmond (Gas only)
City of Surrey (Electrical only)
City of Vancouver (Electrical and Gas)

District of West Vancouver (Electrical only)
Federal Government
Federally regulated sites may be owned or operated by the Government of Canada, a federal agency or crown corporation, or relate to a private entity working in an industry that is federally regulated, such as shipping, aviation, or telecommunications.

As a result of recent case law regarding the division of powers between federal and provincial regulation, the Safety Standards Act applies throughout BC unless there is a conflict between the Safety Standards Act and federal regulations which apply on a particular site. A conflict generally arises where it is not reasonably possible for a person to comply with both the Safety Standards Act and the applicable federal legislation and regulations.

Technical Safety BC would like to confirm that the Safety Standards Act applies to sites that are owned or operated by the federal government in BC. As a result, contractors and owners are required to take out installation permits and operating permits from Technical Safety BC for regulated equipment, and to comply with all other requirements of the Act.

We understand that some owners and contractors have recently been advised by some federal agencies that Technical Safety BC does not have jurisdiction on federal sites and that operating permits are not required. We disagree with this interpretation and are currently engaging with various federal agencies to reach an agreement on permit requirements for federal sites. In the interest of safety, it is our position that all duty holders take out operating permits to ensure appropriate safety oversight of regulated equipment.

First Nations
Technical Safety BC administers the Safety Standards Act and the Railway Safety Act which apply throughout British Columbia. This means that any regulated work on First Nations land, whether by Indigenous or non-Indigenous contractors, will require all necessary permits, licenses, and certifications.

The Safety Standards Act and Railway Safety Act may not apply on First Nations land in certain situations depending on the terms of a treaty or conflicting federal legislation.

Technical Safety BC recognizes that we cannot promote equitable access to safety for all communities across BC without first developing and increasing our internal capacity for meaningful and respectful relationships with Indigenous communities and Nations. We continue to develop respectful engagement principles and increase the cultural competency of our employees through dialogue with Indigenous communities throughout the province.

In recognition of the rights of Indigenous people in Canada, including the right to self-determination, we hope that this approach will open the door for innovative models of safety oversight created by and in partnership with Indigenous communities.

Do wheelchair lifts require a permit?,"We do not have jurisdiction over wheelchair lifts. For information on permits related to home elevating devices, please refer to Technical Safety BC's Elevating Devices page.
The source is: https://www.technicalsafetybc.ca/technologies/elevating-devices/home-elevating-devices ","Home Elevating Devices
The manufacturing, installation and maintenance of home elevating devices must be completed according to CSA codes.
Overview
Making home modifications such as installing residential lifts or elevators can provide peace of mind and flexibility for those who want to stay in their homes after a loss of mobility, strength or agility.

However, the quality of the installation can affect the safety of the people who use them. That's why it's important to take the necessary steps to ensure the work is done properly.

BC Safety Standards
Although we do not directly regulate the installation of these devices, the manufacturing, installation and maintenance of the devices must be completed according to Canadian Standards Association code to ensure the safety of users.

The elevating device must comply with one of the following Canadian Standards Association codes:

Lifts for Persons with Physical Disabilities CAN/CSA-B355
Private Residence Lifts for Persons with Physical Disabilities CAN/CSA-B613
Private Residence Elevators CAN/CSA-B44 SEC 5.3
Private Residence Inclined Elevators CAN/CSA-B44 SEC 5.4
Canadian Electrical Code CAN/CSA – C22.1
Getting started
The design of a lift or residential elevator installation is typically complex, involving architectural, structural and electrical elements. It is not a project to be tackled by a handyman.

Start by researching local medical equipment suppliers and elevating contractors who offer lifts and residential elevators. Ask friends and professionals for recommendations and contact the Better Business Bureau to ensure the supplier is in good standing. Use our Find a licensed contractor tool to find a class H elevating contractor who specializes in these devices.

Although not mandatory, we recommend having the contractor make a home visit so they can make recommendations on the feasibility of different types of lifts and residential elevators. Most contractors offer this at no charge. If possible, also arrange for a health professional such as a physiotherapist or occupational therapist to be present for the site visit. They can help ensure that the type of device being recommended will meet your current and future needs.

Different types of lifts and elevators
Vertical Platform Lift (enclosed or unenclosed)
Incline Platform Lift (curved or straight)
Stair Chair Lift (curved or straight)
Residential Elevator
Find a Licensed Contractor
Search for contractors who are licensed to perform regulated work in BC.
Purchasing an elevating device
You can purchase elevating devices from a general or elevating contractor, or from one of many local medical equipment suppliers. Ensure the product is manufactured to the correct safety codes listed above.

Some used devices can pose a safety risk. Always have the device inspected by a licensed contractor before you purchase or install it.

Use our Find a Licensed Contractor tool to locate a licensed class H elevating contractor who specializes in these devices.

Considerations
Purchasing a lift or elevating device is a major investment and gathering some key information can help you make an informed decision. Before purchasing a device, consider the following:

Do I want to purchase new or used?
If I am purchasing a used device, how can I ensure that it is safe to install/use?
Is the device manufactured according to the most recent Canadian codes?
What are the safety features of the device?
Will I need a building or electrical permit to install the device?
Is the contractor or subcontractor I hire licensed and/or experienced with this type of installation?
Safety features
The following features are essential for ensuring your safety and the safety of others living in or visiting your home:

Doors and gates: All vertical lifts should be equipped with a door/gate at each landing. The door design should incorporate a certified interlock and eliminate any pinching or shearing hazards.
Interlock mechanisms on doors and gates: This device prevents operation of the drive unit unless the door or gate on the landing is locked in the closed position.
Operation controls: All lifts are required to have constant pressure controls, elevators can have one-touch controls. It is dangerous to have automatic operation on unenclosed platforms and lifts.
Stopping devices: The lift should be equipped with stopping devices to stop the lift at landings and in some cases when the lift travels beyond its normal landings.
Safeties: Safeties stop the lift and hold it in position in the event of suspension or drive failure.
A manual lowering or raising system: This is necessary in case of a power outage or a mechanical malfunction. An emergency battery backup system is also a good option.
Safety edges/surfaces: Where potential shearing, crushing, trapping or abrading hazards exist, the lift should be equipped with safety edges, surfaces or sensors.
Safe platforms: Including handrails, adequate lighting, emergency backup lighting and a smooth platform surface free of tripping hazards.
Communication: An emergency telephone or other communication system in case of emergency or entrapment.
General design: The equipment should be designed in a way that protects the user and anyone nearby from falling, tripping, physical shock, electric shock and fire.
Finding the right contractor/installer
Obtaining a trustworthy contractor/installer is just as essential as purchasing a safe device. The following are steps you can take that will help ensure you have the right person for the job:

Ask for estimates from at least three different suppliers/contractors to assess a reasonable charge for installation.
Check the credentials of the seller, manufacturer, and installer by asking for letters of recommendation or checking their status with the Better Business Bureau.
Ask them to explain how their products comply with the related Canadian Standards code.
Ask if they will provide (and sign off on) an affidavit stating that the work performed meets Canadian standards.
Ask how long they have been in business and how many lifts or elevators they have installed.
Ensure that your contractor is licensed and in good standing.
Obtaining a permit
Other than for the simplest stair lift installations, you will likely need a building permit. A building permit is necessary whenever the installation of a lift or residential elevator requires structural changes to the house or affects safety systems such as stairs, fire separations, and guardrails. Electrical permits are required when any changes are made to electrical wiring in your home. Contact your municipal office and ask a building inspector about safety standards, licensing, and inspection for residential lifts and elevators.

Inspection and certification
Lifts and elevators in private residences are not regulated by any provincial or municipal authority. As a result, consumers should do their due diligence in choosing the supplier and manufacturer. Ask for these two things as a minimum:

Equipment Code compliance certificates for the equipment.
Installation Code compliance certificates for installation.
Maintenance
Lifts and residential elevators are mechanical devices that can break down and therefore need regular servicing. Maintenance is generally complex and should be done by an expert. The manufacturer must give you a recommended maintenance schedule, which may be in the form of a manual.

To ensure your device is serviced on a regular basis, you may want to consider purchasing a maintenance contract from a reputable supplier or entering into a maintenance and service contract with a licensed contractor.

Decommissioning, including the complete or partial removal of a regulated product, is an alteration as defined by the Safety Standards Act. Decommissioning is a regulated activity and may only be performed by individuals who possess the appropriate class of contractor's license for the scope of work to be performed, demonstrating that they have the required knowledge and skills to perform the activities safely.

Decommissioned products may be disposed of, reused, or abandoned in place in a safe inoperable condition. Dismantling of products that have been effectively decommissioned as described in this directive is not a regulated activity.

Licensed contractors must assess the risks associated with any planned decommissioning activities and ensure they are effectively mitigated and controlled prior to proceeding. Risks may include toxicity, flammability, corrosivity, asphyxiation, and stored energy due to pressure.

Where decommissioning activities are complex and/or risks affecting life, health, or property are identified, decommissioning plans should be developed.

At minimum, decommissioned equipment must:

Have all energy sources removed (i.e. electrical, gas, etc.)
Have contents removed
Be cleaned and/or purged when required
Be physically removed/disconnected from the system and process
Be permanently deactivated and ready for dismantling
The licensed contractor, in collaboration with the owner, is responsible for ensuring that the decommissioned equipment has been brought to a safe state. The contractor must provide the owner with documentation verifying that decommissioning is complete and the equipment is safe for dismantling and transport.

If decommissioned equipment is not suitable for reuse, the code and manufacturer's nameplates must be removed, and the equipment must be rendered inoperable to prevent reuse.

Owner Responsibilities
Owners must:

Ensure that decommissioning activities are performed only by individuals possessing the appropriate class of contractor’s license and certificate of qualification.
Obtain written documentation from the licensed contractor confirming that the regulated product has been decommissioned and is safe and ready for dismantling.
Notify Technical Safety BC upon completion of decommissioning using the Operating Permit Declaration of Status Change form.
Obtain confirmation from the licensed contractor whether the equipment is suitable for reuse and, if not, direct the contractor to render it inoperable.
Regulated products not decommissioned in accordance with this directive are considered operational or available for operation, and owners remain responsible for compliance with all applicable requirements.

Licensed Contractor Responsibilities
Licensed contractors must:

Assess risks associated with decommissioning and ensure all activities are performed safely and in compliance with regulations and codes.
Perform regulated work only within the scope of their license.
Provide owners with documentation verifying that decommissioning is complete and the product is safe for dismantling.
Remove nameplates and render equipment inoperable if it is not suitable for reuse.

I client is asking about an electrical related product that he wants to buy from china to install in his home for his heating. he said it is approved under Canadian industry standards but not CSA. Would this be an ELSO question or design registration?,"General Details

Under section 21(1) of the Electrical Safety Regulation, electrical equipment must bear evidence of either a mark or a label of a certification agency accredited by the Standards Council of Canada, or an approval label issued by Technical Safety BC or other accredited organization under section 10 of the Safety Standards Act such as the SPE1000 model code field approval. Changes to accreditation of certification bodies, or their markings, may occur without notice. Visit the Standards Council of Canada website for a complete listing of accredited certification bodies (www.scc.ca). This Information Bulletin provides examples of certification and approval marks and labels that are acceptable in British Columbia and may not include all accepted marks.

The Standards Council of Canada accredits two types of organizations for electrical equipment approval:

Certification bodies
Inspection bodies
The term ""Certification Agency"" is defined in the Safety Standards Act, and Electrical Safety Regulation, Section 20.1. However, the terms ""certification body"" (CB) and ""inspection body"" (IB) are also used throughout the industry. For the purpose of the Safety Standards Act, ""certification agency"" includes any ""certification body"" or ""inspection body"" that is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada. Details regarding the accreditation process can be found on the Standards Council of Canada website at www.scc.ca.
